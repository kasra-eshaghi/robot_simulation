Plan:
    simulate a maze solving robot. The robot is initialized at an unknown position within a known map. It then has to localize, find its way to a pick up point, and then find its way to a dropoff point.
Subtasks:
    1. Find a way for operator to give the inputs to the system (map, initial position, goal position, etc.)
    2. Plan structure for simulating robot with drive, sensor measurements, and anything else needed
